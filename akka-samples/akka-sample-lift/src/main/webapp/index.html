  <h2>Welcome to the Akka + Lift Sample</h2>
  <p>This page is served by Lift, and Lift alone. In order to demonstrate how AkkaServlet and <br />
    Lift can work in harmony we have supplied a sample JAX-RS service that is secured using <br />
    Lift's HTTP Basic Authentication.</p>
  
  <p>To access the Akka service, visit <a href="/liftcount">this url</a> and enter the 
    following access credentials:</p>
    
  <p>user: <strong>someuser</strong><br />
     password: <strong>1234</strong></p>
