h2. Distributed Transactional RESTful Persistent Actors

h3. "http://akkasource.org":http://akkasource.org

Akka implements a unique hybrid of:
* The Actor model (Actors and Active Objects), which gives you:
** Concurrency (high-level and simple)
** Asynchronous, non-blocking and highly performant components.
** Supervision with "let-it-crash" semantics. Components are loosely coupled and restarted upon failure.
* Software Transactional Memory (STM).
* BASE and ACID persistence - Pluggable Eventually Consistent or ACID distributed scalable persistent storage.
* Remoting - Distributed services with supervision and error management
* REST (JAX-RS) and Comet bindings.
* Monitoring and Management

Akka can be used in two different ways:
* As a library: used by a web app, to be put into ‘WEB-INF/lib’
* As a kernel: stand-alone kernel, embedding the servlet container

See the "Use-case and Deployment Scenarios":http://wiki.github.com/jboner/akka/use-case-and-deployment-scenarios for details.

h1. What's Akka all about? Why should I care?  

If you are new to Akka then I suggest you start with either the:

* "High Level View":http://wiki.github.com/jboner/akka/modules-the-high-level-view; which is outlining the different modules in Akka.
* "Use-case and Deployment Scenarios":http://wiki.github.com/jboner/akka/use-case-and-deployment-scenarios; outlining how and in which use-case and deployment scenarios can I use Akka?
* "Examples":http://wiki.github.com/jboner/akka/examples; showing how to build a RESTful, transactional, persistent Active Object and Actor.

After that you can dive into the "Reference Manual":http://wiki.github.com/jboner/akka/akka-reference-manual.
