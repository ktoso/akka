Akka implements a unique hybrid of:
* The Actor model (Actors and Active Objects), which gives you:
** Concurrency (high-level and simple)
** Asynchronous, non-blocking and highly performant components.
** Supervision with "let-it-crash" semantics. Components are loosely coupled and restarted upon failure.
* Software Transactional Memory (STM).
* BASE and ACID persistence - Pluggable Eventually Consistent or ACID distributed scalable persistent storage.
* Remoting - Distributed services with supervision and error management
* REST (JAX-RS) and Comet bindings.
* Monitoring and Management
